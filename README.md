Data Structure Simulations in C

Description:
This repository showcases a collection of data structure simulations implemented in C, providing a hands-on learning experience for understanding fundamental data structures and their operations. Each simulation is carefully designed to demonstrate the underlying concepts and functionalities of popular data structures, aiding learners in building a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving.

Key Features:

Array Simulation: Explore the dynamics of arrays, including insertion, deletion, and searching operations, to grasp the basics of one of the simplest yet essential data structures.

Linked List Simulation: Delve into the world of linked lists, understanding single, double, and circular linked list implementations, along with common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Stack and Queue Simulation: Experience the power of stack and queue data structures, understanding their principles, and mastering operations such as push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue.

Binary Tree Simulation: Learn about binary trees and their traversal algorithms, including in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals, enabling a comprehensive understanding of hierarchical data structures.

Hash Table Simulation: Dive into hash tables and hash functions, exploring collision resolution techniques, such as chaining and open addressing, to grasp efficient data retrieval and storage.

Graph Simulation: Study graph data structures, including representations like adjacency matrix and adjacency list, and explore traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).


Contributions:
Contributions to this repository are welcomed from the open-source community. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, you can contribute new data structure simulations, optimize existing code, or add comprehensive documentation to enhance the learning experience for others.

Let's embark on this journey of mastering data structures in C together. By learning through hands-on simulations and collaborating with fellow developers, we can build a stronger foundation in programming and problem-solving, unlocking new possibilities in software development.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
